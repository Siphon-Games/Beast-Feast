<!-- Branch STRATEGY -->

## Branch Strategy

We try our best to follow a guideline on how we name our branches, so that your work can be easily matched with the ticket that is assigned to you.

Our branch naming strategy requires the ticket number, as well as the type of ticket. For example:

    feature ticket PROJEC-123: feat_123/summary-of-ticket
    bug ticket PROJEC-321: bugfix_321/summary-of-ticket
	chore ticket PROJECT-111: chore_111/summary-of-tickett
